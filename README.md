Project to complete: Pokedex.

Design:
    Simple grid layout system. The user clicks on a pokemon thumbnail and a pop up that displays a larger image of the pokemon with additional details in a pokemon card layout. From there you have the option to catch the pokemon and it will add it to their caught list and also will be blacked out than the rest of the uncaught pokemon in the grid system. Clicking on a caught pokemon will bring back the pokemon card pop up and there they have the option to release.
